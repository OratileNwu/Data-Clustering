# Data-Clustering
The goal is to identify distinct user groups based on their activity
levels (steps per day) and sleep patterns (hours slept per night). This exercise aims to
enhance students' understanding of clustering algorithms, particularly KMeans, and
their application in exploratory data analysis.
